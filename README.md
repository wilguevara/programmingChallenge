# programmingChallenge
This is my uncompleted assign

# A list of any requirements you could not implement.
- Consuming the REST API for holidays
- Creating the list of calendars based on the days input
- Some invalid days

# Bugs you’ve identified but didn’t have time to fix.
- Cross domain requests, CORS when trying to extracting data from rest API

#Things you would do if you had more time to complete the task
- Create a best user experience and UI design
- Complete the cors errors, if i had access to the backend, set my app server IP in a whitelist or similar.
